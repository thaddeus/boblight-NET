About
=========

This repository contains the base class used for communication with a boblight server. It also has a .NET interface for manipulating the boblight system.

boblight is a client/server model used for controlling lights. It is often used on a Raspberry Pi to control strings of LEDs. The boblight project was made most popular through the release of an XBMC plugin which controlled the boblight server based upon the video media being played. You can see an example of this at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwRvZsxAKh0
